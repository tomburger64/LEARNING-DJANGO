# LEARNING-DJANGO

### After a bad-timed attempt at learning spring & spring boot, I understood that it was wiser for me to go with something simpler to learn like Django for backend, considering I didn't ever really got any material taught concerning backend outside of prog languages

This way, I'll practice my python and also dive into backend for a framework that's pretty well documented over the web (as a high level language / reputed to be the "easiest" framework to learn in terms of learning curve, which's probably the best choice for me considering my background of no backend taught in 2 years of IT school)

I really wanna give into this one and not give up, whether it's because I have no idea how I'm doing stuff, or because I don't directly get what I'm doing in the big/small picture.
I plan on going all the way this time !
