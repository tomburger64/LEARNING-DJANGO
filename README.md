# LEARNING-DJANGO

### After a bad-timed attempt at learning spring & spring boot, I understood that it was wiser for me to go with something simpler to learn like Django for backend, considering I didn't ever really got any material taught concerning backend outside of the languages by themselves.

This way, I'll practice my python and also progress dive into backend for a framework that's pretty well documented over the web (as a high level language / reputed to be the "easiest" framework to learn in terms of learning curve, which's probably the best considering my background of... No backend ever taught through 2 years of IT school, yikes)

I really wanna give into this one and not give up because I have no idea how I'm doing stuff that I can manage to get that I'm doing, I plan on going all the way this time !
